# mqtt-client-wrapper

A modestly opinionated wrapper for [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) that exposes an API for configuring message dispatch and client lifecycle event handlers.

## What does this wrapper offer on top of MQTT.js?

1. Add topic subscriptions with an associated handler for all messages received on that topic
